## Details

This smart contract is a bank of users registrations. The goal for me was to write contract using functions, modifier, natspec standard, constructor and an "administration" by the owner.

It's a contract for educational purposes.

### How the contract works

Users can register their names in the smart contract, read and delete it. They can also get the count of registered users.

Owner can add a list of users in the contract, delete the registration of a particular user, display all the registration and give the "Owner"'s role to someone.
